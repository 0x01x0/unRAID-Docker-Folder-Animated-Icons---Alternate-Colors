Ground7 is offering to animate any new icon requests. However, he is not going to be creating the vector files necessary for him to animate. I will gladly take requests (within reason) to create the vector files. The more info/samples you can provide, the better. Please feel free to enter your request on my thread here:

Enjoy.
